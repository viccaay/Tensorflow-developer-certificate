    "\n",
    "Welcome to this assignment! During this week you saw different ways to handle sequence-like data. You saw how some Keras' layers such as `GRU`, `Conv` and `LSTM` can be used to tackle problems in this space. Now you will put this knowledge into practice by creating a model architecture that does not overfit.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment you will be using a variation of the [Sentiment140 dataset](http://help.sentiment140.com/home), which contains 1.6 million tweets alongside their respective sentiment (0 for negative and 4 for positive).\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need to create the helper functions very similar to the ones you coded in previous assignments pre-process data and to tokenize sentences. However the objective of the assignment is to find a model architecture that will not overfit.\n",
